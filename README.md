The analysis of a collection of approximately 200,000 news
articles focused on Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial
Intelligence reveals valuable insights regarding the industries and
job lines that are likely to experience significant impact from AI in
the coming years. The findings align with previous reports, such
as Goldman Sachs' study, which indicated that around 25% of
tasks in the US and Europe could be automated using AI.
• Not all industries will be affected equally by AI automation.
Certain sectors, such as office tasks, legal services, architecture,
and social sciences, have a potential for automation exceeding
30%. Conversely, industries like construction, installation, and
building maintenance are expected to be relatively unaffected by
AI adoption.
• Supporting evidence from the Facebook Research paper
emphasizes Moravec's paradox, which posits that AI faces greater
challenges in sensorimotor skills rather than abstract thought or
reasoning. This reinforces the predictions made by Goldman
Sachs, indicating that tasks involving physical labor and manual
dexterity will be less impacted by AI compared to those involving
cognitive and analytical capabilities.
• The emergence of novel technologies and algorithms, such as AI
for image generation and Conversational AI, represents a
paradigm shift in the adoption of AI technologies and data
science. These advancements open up new possibilities for
automation and improved employee productivity.
• During the course of this project, I have carried out an analysis to
identify the top reasons contributing to the success of Data
Science as well as why certain types of applications succeed and
why others fail.
• By performing topic modelling, I was able to determine major
topics which contributed to the success and limitations of Data
Science in today’s world.
• Named Entity Recognition identifies the presence of legal and
political entities corresponding to the text corpus (particularly
associated with negative sentiment).
• Frequently repeating tokens across articles with a negative
sentiment indicate external macro-economic and market related
analysis in the news.
• Major entities across both negative and positive news articles
indicated major tech companies such as OpenAI, IBM, google, and
Microsoft.
