Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July 1, 2019. Peoples Daily OnlineLi WenmingThanks to the application of an artificial intelligence AIempowered roadside electronic toll collection ETC system, Chinas capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.As the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding 90 percent.With the AIempowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time, recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.Since the summer of 2019, roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider, Wang said.The smart roadside ETC system AIpark Sky Eye adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijingbased leading smart parking solution provider.The companys intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the countrys innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in 2018 by Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology MIIT.Traditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.Such problems dont exist in smart machines. The AIpark Sky Eye system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.Each set of cameras of the AIpark Sky Eye system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for 24 hours a day. The data collected by frontend cameras are processed using multidimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.The most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by highmounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes.For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians, Xiang said.Once the highmounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the AIpark Sky Eye system.Besides managing parking fee collection, highmounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.So far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than 20 cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking industry.123PhotosNaval fleet steams in East China SeaNewborn golden snubnosed monkey makes debutIn pics: birds across ChinaGrain painting studio helps villagers to increase incomeRelated StoriesExhibition highlighting artscience integration opens in BeijingChinas AI industry poised to enter boom timesAlibaba outlines 10 technology trends for 2019Chinas leading AI enterprise iFlytek to develop health information technologyCheetah Mobile wades into artificial intelligenceChina overtakes the US in investment in AI5 million artificial intelligence talents urgently needed in ChinaGraduate students give voice to sign languageArtificial Intelligence in real livesMicrosoft embraces artificial intelligenceAbout Peoples Daily Online   Join Us  Contact UsCopyright  2021 Peoples Daily Online.

AI is used in various functions inside smartphones such as intelligent power optimization, imaging, virtual assistants, and to enhance device performance. The report highlights the fact that AI has become the most important technology in modern smartphones. The push to add ondevice AI computational power to enable Edge AI computing is a priority for smartphone and chipset vendors. Strategy Analytics estimates that 71 of all smartphones sold worldwide in 2021 will have ondevice AI, says Associate Director VillePetteri Ukonaho. Advantages of ondevice AI computing include lower latency, better data privacy and overall lower power consumption.An Artificial Intelligence AI smartphone is one that uses an AI core  processor designed to run machine learning and deep learning tasks. AI smartphones run AI tasks locally on the device with the help of dedicated AI cores and AI coprocessors with little or no data transmitted to the cloud. Examples of AI smartphones include Apples iPhone 12 Pro Max and Samsungs Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G.Artificial Intelligence has become a key technology in higherend smartphones, says Ken Hyers, Director at Strategy Analytics. A smartphone equipped with ondevice AI can significantly improve important tasks like helping users take better pictures, deliver longer battery life through efficient power management, improve the speed of response by digital assistants, and power Augmented Reality, among other tasks. This makes smartphones more useful tools for users.Modern smartphones give consumers access to their own personal AI powered supercomputer, says VillePetteri Ukonaho. With the help of ondevice Artificial Intelligence, virtual assistants like Siri and Googles Assistant have become more intelligent and aware of their environment. Strategy Analytics new report estimates that in 2021 over 80 of smartphones globally will have virtual assistants and the share will grow to 97 by 2025.With the enhanced AI capabilities ondevice, virtual assistants have become more intelligent and aware of their environment, comments Ken Hyers. Strategy Analytics report finds that Googles Assistant is the top virtual assistant in 2021 with over 60 share followed by Apples Siri.Ondevice AI is powered by physical silicon cores such as Apples Neural Engine or distributed software frameworks such as Qualcomm Neural Processing Engine NPE that use algorithms to offload AI computation to several processors CPU, GPU and DSP. Physical AI cores have greater capability to handle complex AI computations, thus those are being introduced by all major chip vendors such as Mediatek, Samsung and HiSilicon, says VillePetteri Ukonaho.Camera AI has become one of the key selling points of imaging focused smartphones, says Ken Hyers and continues, Artificial Intelligence features such as object recognition or motion detection are becoming growingly important in premium smartphones. In the report Strategy Analytics concludes that over 30 of smartphones already have AI enhanced camera functionalities.Strategy Analytics finds in its latest report that technologies such as 5G will greatly benefit from the new capabilities improved by AI and vice versa.

The research reveals that Apple has acquired more AI companies than anyone else between 2016 and 2020.Apple comes ahead of companies like Accenture, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook when it comes to the acquisition of companies and startups that specialize in AI. In five years, Apple has bought 25 AI companies, while Google has bought 14.When considering the data from Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook combined, more than 60 of AI companies were acquired between 2016 and 2020. AI has remained a key focus area for tech giants and growing competition to dominate the space has resulted in an acquisition spree among these companies, said GlobalData.With the advances in technologies that rely on artificial intelligence, ranging from virtual assistants to neural engines, its expected that these big tech companies would invest in such category. As for Apple, most of the acquisitions seem to be related to improving Siri, as noted by Nicklas Nilsson, Senior Analyst on the Thematic Research Team at GlobalData.Apple has gone on a shopping spree in efforts to catch up with Google Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. Siri was first on the market, but it consistently ranks below the two in terms of smartness, which is partly why Apple is far behind in smart speaker sales. Apple also want to make sure to keep its strong position within wearables. It is the dominant player in smartwatches. The acquisition of Xnor.ai last year was made to improve its onedge processing capabilities, which has become important as it eliminates the need for data to be sent to the cloud, thereby improving data privacy.Of course, there are investments in other areas as well. Lighthouse AI, a home security camera startup, was acquired by Apple in 2019, while Drive.ai, also acquired in 2019, had multiple technologies related to autonomous vehicles. As always, Apple doesnt detail the purpose of each acquisition.FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

The initial integration provides artificial intelligence AI suggested replies in live chat, allowing sales representatives reps to immediately respond to complex customer questions without ever having to leave the conversation.Drift Logo PRNewsfotoDrift.com, Inc.PRNewswireThe AI will suggest a reply for the sales rep to use based on their companys website content and marketing materials, the context of that specific conversation and GPT. The sales rep will have the option to customize the suggested reply before sending, or dismiss it and generate a new suggested reply if the first one didnt meet their needs. The ability to generate suggested replies by repurposing any available content also provides realtime onthejob training for new sales reps which currently takes three months on average, teaching them how to respond accurately and in the right brand voice.Gaps in education and training were cited as the top barrier to AI adoption by 63 of marketers and sales reps polled in Drifts recent 2022 State of Marketing and Sales AI Report. Large language models, like ChatGPT, are helping change that by making AI usable and understandable to everyone. It is one of the first AI technologies made available to the public in a way that nontechnical experts can understand and experiment with.The buzz around ChatGPT, and the widespread experimentation that followed, has only underscored that conversationbased AI is paving the way of the future. But, it needs to be tailored to solve meaningful business challenges, said Matt Tippets, senior vice president at Drift. With Drifts ability to use Conversational AI to contextualize responses that augment the efforts of human teams, weve created a feature that helps sales reps of all experience levels be more productive, particularly relevant now with pressure on during a more difficult economic climate.While B2B sales and marketing professionals are excited by the possibilities of GPT implementations, many are hesitant about potential risks. By combining Drifts trusted Conversational AI with GPT, marketing and sales reps will be able to more quickly and accurately respond to customers in chat.This aligns with Drifts mission to help businesses connect with people at the right time, in the right place, with the right conversation.Additional features that will be available later this year within the Drift GPT integration include:Automated content creation and ongoing optimization of playbooksAutomated onboarding and AI topic trainingPersonalizing sales outreach and prioritizing target accountsIve always admired Drifts customercentric approach to building practical AI tools, and suggested replies is a great addition that will immediately increase productivity for users, said Paul Roetzer, founder and CEO of Marketing AI Institute.Drifts GPT integration will enter its Beta stage in March with select customers. Shortly thereafter, the integration will become more widely available to Drifts customers and new features will be added.To learn more about the new Drift GPT features or to join the waitlist, click here.About DriftDrift, the Conversation Cloud company, helps businesses connect with people at the right time, in the right place with the right conversation.

Wouldnt youId take Fridays off. The way I imagine it, itd be just a few years from now. A robot in a butlers uniform would serve us drinks in the backyard on what used to be just another workday. Id toss a ball around with the kids while ChatGPT did their homework for them.Who says the world is going to hell and the future is bleak Artificial intelligence, advanced robotics and job automation hold out the hope of less work, more leisure and long weekends every weekend.Thats the view, anyway, of Christopher Pissarides, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in economics and believes that thanks to AI and automation, society could move to a fourday week easily.He said itin an article that appeared in the L.A. Timeslast week.They could take away a lot of boring things that we do at work  and then leave only the interesting stuff to human beings, he added.Pissarides has writtenthat automation gets a bad rap and that we should embrace AI and automation without hesitation while helping workers make the transition to the new economy.Itd be great if hes right that productivity gains and increases in efficiency will be reinvested, spurring new innovations, creating new jobs and industries, and driving economic growth as older, less productive jobs are replaced with more advanced occupations and we all get Fridays off with no cut in pay.But Im skeptical that itll happen easily.I realize its presumptuous of me to question the optimism of a Nobel Prize winner, especially given that I didnt do so good in Intro to Economics 45 years ago.But, with all due respect, count me among those who wonder whether the financial benefits of automation will really be put to use improving workers wellbeing  or whether theyll just feed higher profits for shareholders and heftier bonuses for executives, thereby exacerbating income inequality.Count me among those who worry that employers will work hard to grab most of the savings for themselves unless society forces them not to.Automation, of one sort or another, is as old as humans are, and fear of losing jobs to machines goes back at least to the textile mills of the Industrial Revolution. Many of us learned in school aboutthe Luddites, a secret organization of disaffected early 19th century English mill workers who went around destroying automated looms and other newfangled machinery they feared would eliminate their jobs or worsen labor conditions.These days automation is moving faster than ever. A Goldman Sachs report released last month said300 million jobs worldwidecould be impacted or disrupted thanks to generative AI alone. A report by theMcKinsey Global Institutedetermined that up to half the jobs people do in the world could theoretically be automated.Already, salespeople are disappearing at my local RiteAid because of selfservice checkout machines. Parking garage attendants can hardly be found thanks to automatic gates, ticketdispensing machines and selfpaying kiosks. At airports, boarding passes are dispensed by machines. Baggage handlers are being displaced by robots, immigration officers by facial recognition technology.And do we think those workers are all off enjoying threeday weekendsWith the extraordinary innovations in AI, automation may soon move beyond bluecollar and lessskilled workers, increasingly affecting socalled knowledge workers with college educations. Whos at risk Think software engineers, tax preparers, copy editors and paralegals. For starters.Many economists share Pissarides optimistic view. They note that, historically, when automation has eliminated jobs, new ones offset the losses. Productivity gains drive down prices, which drives up spending and creates jobs. And innovation itself requires workers: Although we no longer employ blacksmiths, weve got auto mechanics, solar panel installers and airline pilots.One Massachusetts Institute of Technology studyfound that more than 60 of jobs in the U.S. in 2018 hadnt been invented in 1940.Furthermore, robots can do jobs that are undesirable or highly dangerous or require superhuman strength and stamina. In many cases, robots are faster, stronger, more accurate and more efficient than people.So there are definitely benefits to automation. But the challenge is to ensure theyre spread around.MIT economist Daron Acemoglu says that over the last four decades, jobs lost to automation havenotbeen replaced by an equal number of new ones. Since the late 1980s, he says, automation has increased income inequality rather than raising all boats.The real beneficiaries of automation during that period Corporations, their owners and in some cases workers with very high skill levels, especially those with postgraduate degrees.The case that workers will benefit from massscale automation is pretty weak, Acemoglu told me. The evidence indicates that the productivity gains from automation of the last four decades have been largely captured by companies and managers.Now Im not suggesting we should  or could  stop innovation or halt progress.But to mitigate the enormous disruption, the transition cannot be left entirely to the caprice of employers. Automations benefits must not simply be dispatched directly into the pockets of the Jeff Bezoses and Elon Musks of the world.Pissarides urges the government to provide income and jobtransition support to workers.Harry J. Holzer, a public policy professor at Georgetown University, calls for tax incentives and subsidies for good job creation. K12 education, he says, should be retooled to prepare 21st century workers with the communication skills, critical thinking abilities, creativity and good judgment that will be valuable and marketable in the new economy.Too often in history, society has left workers to fend for themselves in times of dramatic economic change. Is government committed, this time, to ensuring it doesnt happen againLike everyone else, Im eager for my fourday workweek.But I dont kid myself that itll happen on its own thanks to the generosity of the modernday mill owners. Itll take a fight.

The ripples caused by the COVID19 crisis are felt far and wide, and the worlds economies have taken a staggering blow. As with most things in life, however, this crisis has also brought some interesting side effects. Special feature                        Digital Transformation: A CXOs Guide                    Reimagining business for the digital age is the numberone priority for many of todays top executives. We offer practical advice and examples of how to do it right.Read MoreThe way to cope for practically every one of us, including organizations of all sizes and shapes, can be summarized in one infamous buzzword: digital transformation. This can mean different things depending on who you ask, from video calls and remote collaboration apps to more software as a service, cloud and machine learning investment. Also: Digital transformation: The difference between success and failure Whatever digital transformation means, as the aphorism by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella went, the COVID19 crisis brought years worth of digital transformation in months. Those who had strategically invested are reaping the benefits, those who did not are either out of the game or left with a patchwork of disparate initiatives and apps in place. Theres one thing in common however, regardless of which part in that journey youre at: as digital transformation accelerates, an increasing part of all business activity is leaving its footprint behind in the form of data. Eventually, every employee, customer and supplier interaction, every lead, every information bit and every process, will either take place digitally or be documented digitally. What this means in turn is that in theory, it should be possible to not just derive insights, as the promise of big data and analytics has been, but to go from data to information, and from information to knowledge. Yes, this does sound a lot like the journey towards the fourth industrial revolution, and the promise of artificial intelligence. In the near future, organizations will be datadriven, and the economy will be knowledgebased. Heres a shortlist of technologies and processes that can support it, and what they are about.  The data pyramid: from data to knowledge The representation of the relationships among data, information, knowledge and  ultimately  wisdom, known as the data pyramid, has long been part of the language of information science. In the new knowledgebased digital world, encoding and making use of business and operational knowledge is the key to making progress and staying competitive. The representation of the relationships among data, information, knowledge and ultimately wisdom, known as thedata pyramid, has long been part of the language of information scienceSo how do we go from data to information, and from information to knowledge Data is a collection of facts in a raw or unorganized form, such as numbers or characters. Without context, data does not mean much. For example, 18122020 is just a sequence of numbers. But if we define this sequence as a date in the DDMMYYY format, we can then interpret it as the 18th of December, 2020. With this added context, the numbers acquire a meaning. Information is data that has been processed in a way that makes it easier to measure, visualize and analyze  for a specific purpose. For example, we can organize our data in a way that exposes relationships between various seemingly disparate and disconnected data points. We can analyze the performance of the Dow Jones index by creating a graph of data points for a particular period of time, based on the data at each days closing. Knowledge is information that has been processed, organized and structured in some way, applied or put into action. For example, by capturing and expressing the meaning of relationships pertaining to our data points, we can automate insights, and extract new knowledge. A knowledge graph of semantic relationships can help explain how certain stocks influence the Dow Jones index, and how different events may affect their prices. Adding context to data turns it to information. Processing information turns it to knowledge. The keys to these transformations are connections and metadata. But there is another wellknown progression at play here. By now, the classification of various forms of analytics from simple to advanced is also well known and understood. The theory behind this classification is that the more advanced forms of analytics lead to AI. Of course, there is an implicit question there: what do we talk about, when we talk about AI  According to todays conventional wisdom, the answer is machine learning, or more specifically even, deep learning. That has not always been held as a selfevident truth, however. It probably wont be held as such for ever either. And it certainly is not held as such for everyone.  For a brief introduction to a more holistic view on AI, and a strong dose of inspiration, we recommend our recent conversation with AI prodigy Gary Marcus. From our part, lets try to approach the analytics progression from a different viewpoint, focusing on a specific data structure: graphs.  Graph Analytics What is the optimal way to go through a number of bridges The history of graph theory is linked to this question. The bridges in question were the bridges of Knigsberg. The year was 1736. And the person who formulated a model to answer this question was Leonhard Euler. Euler was a Swiss scientist and engineer, and much of his work is foundational to modern science. Eulers solution on the bridges of Knigsberg is the basis of graph theory. There is a line connecting Euler to modern data science. What Euler did was to model the bridges and the paths connecting them as nodes and edges in a graph. Euler formalized the relationships between nodes and edges. That formed the basis for many graph algorithms that can tackle problems such as the bridges of Knigsberg. In the new knowledgebased digital world, encoding and making use of business and operational knowledge is the key to making progress and staying competitive.The most famous graph algorithm is probably PageRank the foundation of Googles empire. PageRank models documents on the web as a graph, and uses links among them to derive relevance for a specific query. But Googles success with PageRank is just the tip of the iceberg. From the 18th century to today, a number of graph algorithms have been developed. Path finding, centrality, community detection and similarity are some of the main classes of graph algorithms. Graph algorithms have many applications in data analytics. From eBay and NASA to investigative journalists and independent data scientists, graph analytics power realworld use cases and make a difference every day in areas of recommendations and fraud detection to network analysis and natural language processing. This is why the analyst firm Gartner predicts that graph analytics will grow in the next few years due to the need to ask complex questions across complex data.  Graph Databases Leveraging connections in data is a prominent way of getting value out of data. Graph is the best way of leveraging connections, and graph databases excel at this. Graph databases make expressing and querying connection easy and powerful.  This is why graph databases are a good match in use cases that require leveraging connections in data: Antifraud, Recommendations, Customer 360 or Master Data Management. From operational applications to analytics, and from data integration to machine learning, graph gives you an edge. There is a difference between graph analytics and graph databases. Graph analytics can be performed on any back end, as they only require reading graphshaped data. Graph databases are databases with the ability to fully support both read and write, utilizing a graph data model, API and query language. Graph databases have been around for a long time, but the attention they have been getting since 2017 is off the charts. AWS and Microsoft moving in the domain, with Neptune and Cosmos DB respectively, exposed graph databases to a wider audience. This hitherto niche domain has been the hottest in data management since then. Besides trends, however, there are real reasons why graph databases are interesting, and real use cases they can help with. To quote Gartner again: The application of graph processing and graph DBMSs will grow at 100 percent annually through 2022 to continuously accelerate data preparation and enable more complex and adaptive data science. Graph data stores can efficiently model, explore and query data with complex interrelationships across data silos.Knowledge GraphsConnecting data silos is a prerequisite for knowledge management, and knowledge graphs excel at this. Knowledge graphs are a specific subclass of graphs, also known as semantic graphs. They come with metadata, schema, global identifier, and reasoning capabilities, which makes them ideal for capturing and managing knowledge. Its understandable why many people tend to think of graph as a new technology. The truth, however, is this technology is at least 20 years old. It has been largely initiated by none other than Tim BernersLee, who is also credited as the inventor of the Web. BernersLee published his Semantic Web manifesto in 2001. Although sidelined over the years, these principles and technology are still largely behind the Knowledge Graph renaissance. Google played a key role in the rise of graphs, and knowledge graphs. As the web itself is a prime use case for graphs, PageRank was born. Gartner has included knowledge graphs in its 2020 hype cycle for AI, at the peak of inflated expectationsDespite PageRanks success, crawling and categorizing content on the web is a very hard problem to solve without semantics and metadata. Hence Google embraced semantic technology, and coined the term Knowledge Graph in 2012. This, and the widespread adoption of schema.org that followed, marked the beginning of the meteoric rise of graph technology and knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs can address key challenges such as data governance and data integration. Ultimately, knowledge graphs can serve as the digital substrate to unify the philosophy of knowledge acquisition and organization with the practice of data management in the digital age. And ontologies, the elaborate schemas that govern knowledge graphs, are now being used by the Morgan Stanleys of the world.  Graphs, AI, and natural language processing You would be tempted to think that knowledge graphs are the end all for capturing and managing knowledge you would be wrong. Knowledge graphs excel in capturing knowledge explicitly, in a topdown way. Knowledge graphs are part of AI, the socalled good old AI, or symbolic AI. This is why Gartner has included knowledge graphs in its 2020 hype cycle for AI, at the peak of inflated expectations, no less. Knowledge graphs and ontologies may fare better than any other technology for managing explicit, a priori knowledge, but what about implicit, emergent, evolving knowledge This is where machine learning works well, but here, too, graphs may have a helping hand to lend. What does graph have to do with machine learning A lot, actually. And it goes both ways. Machine learning can help bootstrap and populate knowledge graphs. The information contained in graphs can boost the efficiency of machine learning approaches. What does graph have to do with machine learning A lot, actually. And it goes both ways. Image: OracleMachine learning, and its deep learning subdomain, make a great match for graphs. Machine learning on graphs is still a nascent technology, but one which is full of promise. Amazon, Alibaba, Apple, Facebook and Twitter are just some of the organizations using this in production, and advancing the state of the art. More than 25 of the research published in top AI conferences is graphrelated. Last but not least, according to Facebook AI researcher Fabio Petroni, graphs may not be the best way to obtain knowledge: As human beings, we already invented the best way of representing knowledge  text. With recent advances in Natural Language Processing NLP, we now have machines that can retrieve pieces of context, reason on top of that and solve knowledge intensive tasks without using a knowledge base, just using text and understanding text.Having come full circle, this reference points to the kind of holistic approach to AI, knowledge representation and reasoning that Gary Marcus vision lays out. We have been keeping track of this field, and will continue to do so and report back here.

It also gives investors a sense of what the product can achieve with scale. But, it is important to build the MVP frugally. Heres how BeatO, the Delhibased healthcare startup, did it. 0 claps0 Share on0 claps0 Share onShare onBeing diabetic themselves, Yash Sehgal and Gautam Chopra realised the need for a platform that could give them the insights and information on how well they could manage their blood sugar levels.The duo had an initial hypothesis: for people who monitor their sugar levels  a personalised interpretation of their sugar level readings, along with a realtime intervention  would be very useful in making a positive impact in their blood glucose values.This led them to start the fullstack healthtech platform BeatO in 2015, which provides information and products for diabetes management. With a focus on chronic illness management in India, the startup has over 100,000 users on its platform, adding close to 10,0000 users each month.BeatO provides diabetic patients with a smartphone glucometer and app, which connects them with inhouse specialists, helps share and analyse readings, track fitness levels, and manage diet with a range of diabeticfriendly food products. BeatOs platform has now evolved to track chronic illnesses as well.ALSO READYS Learn From cofounders turning security guards to reaching 2 million homes, the MVP journey of MyGateStart smallIn the beginning, the cofounders focussed on their hypothesis and made a simple app, where users could manually fill in their readings. If the readings were beyond the appropriate range, the inhouse specialist diabetes educators would immediately assist a call to provide insights to the user.We were happy with the initial user engagement and feedback. We received appreciation for these interventions when it was of the utmost importance. However, there was other learning that we felt was needed in the process to make the product more appealing to our users, says Gautam.Firstly, they needed to solve the problem of data acquisition as most users did not want to feed the data in manually. The startup solved this successfully through its smartphoneconnected glucometer device.Secondly, while diabetes educators could call people, we needed a more intelligent system to triage users, and provide more contextualised, personalised actions. This overtime gave birth to HealthNeuron  BeatOs AI engine, explains Gautam.Keep evolvingThe cofounder explains that the product has to be everevolving. As more customers started using the startups platform, several rich insights started to come in, many of which were built into the product. BeatOs product team works very closely with the customer experience team to understand various areas of improvement, as well as areas of further product evolution.By having our ears close to the ground and seeking active feedback and response from our users, we introduce features based on data and the rich insights we gather. There is a balance in the thought process that founders need to strike. As an MVP, it should focus on learning about consumers interest in the product rather than in earnings. Also, at times, there is a tendency to add many features, thereby losing sight of the core value  this can lead to overinvestment by an already capitalstarved startup, explains Gautam.ALSO READYS Learn Heres how founders can master business strategy with five top movesBe nimble and look at dataBeatO cofounders, fairly early into the operations, also concluded that the performance of their product will be based on the data and user feedback.However, to improve and commercialise the product, at times, it may take more time than one envisages. For this, we now try to evaluate what is the effort versus the impact the product will have in the short, mid, or long term, and then decide how we wish to include the product evolution in our pipeline, says Gautam.Keep the focus sharpAccording to Gautam, the team at BeatO focusses on two things Opportunity arising out of a new or evolving market situation: For example, the COVID19 pandemic has provided a unique opportunity for the startup to launch its Virtual Endocrine Clinic, as well as its Diabetes Total Insurance Subscription feature, as both became critical user needs overnight.An outcome of what data tells us: For example, BeatO realised that people responded favourably to compliancebased rewards. In fact, it built this feature, where it demonstrates a great relationship with health economics and health outcomes.Focus on tech, but not over consumer needsFor any startup, during the MVP phase, having a significant focus on learning and observing customers actual behaviour with the product is more important than the tech architecture.The core architecture of the system should be built around the primary offering and should be flexible enough to evolve as new offerings are in place, Gautam says. If a Chief Product Officer CFO is confident that an MVP needs to be commercialised, having a solid core team that drives the tech architecture, early team hiring, and optimising costs can be paramount.The simplest way to manage the architecture is to build small, but think big. This will make the system futureready, and will always have the possibility of enhancements to be added when the time comes, he adds.Advising CPOs, Gautam says, Try getting to the root of the real problem that your product has to solve.Edited by Suman Singh Indias most prolific entrepreneurship conference TechSparks is back With it comes an opportunity for earlystage startups to scale and succeed.

parking efficiency in Chinese citiesBy LiuShiyao Peoples Daily 09:16, March 18, 2021Photo taken on July 1, 2019, shows a sign for electronic toll collection ETC newly set up at a roadside parking space on Yangzhuang road, Shijingshan district, Beijing. Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July 1, 2019. Peoples Daily OnlineLi WenmingThanks to the application of an artificial intelligence AIempowered roadside electronic toll collection ETC system, Chinas capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.As the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding 90 percent.With the AIempowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time, recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.Since the summer of 2019, roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider, Wang said.The smart roadside ETC system AIpark Sky Eye adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijingbased leading smart parking solution provider.The companys intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the countrys innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in 2018 by Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology MIIT.Traditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.Such problems dont exist in smart machines. The AIpark Sky Eye system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.Each set of cameras of the AIpark Sky Eye system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for 24 hours a day. The data collected by frontend cameras are processed using multidimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.The most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by highmounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes.For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians, Xiang said.Once the highmounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the AIpark Sky Eye system.Besides managing parking fee collection, highmounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.So far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than 20 cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking industry.123PhotosNaval fleet steams in East China SeaNewborn golden snubnosed monkey makes debutIn pics: birds across ChinaGrain painting studio helps villagers to increase incomeRelated StoriesExhibition highlighting artscience integration opens in BeijingChinas AI industry poised to enter boom timesAlibaba outlines 10 technology trends for 2019Chinas leading AI enterprise iFlytek to develop health information technologyCheetah Mobile wades into artificial intelligenceChina overtakes the US in investment in AI5 million artificial intelligence talents urgently needed in ChinaGraduate students give voice to sign languageArtificial Intelligence in real livesMicrosoft embraces artificial intelligenceAbout Peoples Daily Online   Join Us  Contact UsCopyright  2021 Peoples Daily Online.

Space ExploredAbout  TodayApple bought more AI companies than anyone else between 2016 and 2020Filipe Espsito Mar. 25th 2021 4:19 pm PT0FacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedInRedditOnce in a while, Apple announces the acquisition of another company or startup, but now, new research from GlobalData shows that Apple is in fact investing heavily in artificial intelligence. The research reveals that Apple has acquired more AI companies than anyone else between 2016 and 2020.Apple comes ahead of companies like Accenture, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook when it comes to the acquisition of companies and startups that specialize in AI. In five years, Apple has bought 25 AI companies, while Google has bought 14.When considering the data from Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook combined, more than 60 of AI companies were acquired between 2016 and 2020. AI has remained a key focus area for tech giants and growing competition to dominate the space has resulted in an acquisition spree among these companies, said GlobalData.With the advances in technologies that rely on artificial intelligence, ranging from virtual assistants to neural engines, its expected that these big tech companies would invest in such category. As for Apple, most of the acquisitions seem to be related to improving Siri, as noted by Nicklas Nilsson, Senior Analyst on the Thematic Research Team at GlobalData.Apple has gone on a shopping spree in efforts to catch up with Google Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. Siri was first on the market, but it consistently ranks below the two in terms of smartness, which is partly why Apple is far behind in smart speaker sales. Apple also want to make sure to keep its strong position within wearables. It is the dominant player in smartwatches. The acquisition of Xnor.ai last year was made to improve its onedge processing capabilities, which has become important as it eliminates the need for data to be sent to the cloud, thereby improving data privacy.Of course, there are investments in other areas as well. Lighthouse AI, a home security camera startup, was acquired by Apple in 2019, while Drive.ai, also acquired in 2019, had multiple technologies related to autonomous vehicles. As always, Apple doesnt detail the purpose of each acquisition.FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

GPT Integration, Advancing AI for B2B Marketers and SellersPublished: Mar. 1, 2023 at 9:00 AM ESTUpdated: 41 minutes agoGPT Integration is Exclusively Available to Drift Customers in Beta Gives Sales Representatives An Extra Pair of Hands, Automating Repetitive Tasks and Improving ProductivityBOSTON, March 1, 2023 PRNewswire Drift, the Conversation Cloud company, today announced a generative pretrained transformer GPT integration using OpenAIs API, available exclusively to select Drift customers. The initial integration provides artificial intelligence AI suggested replies in live chat, allowing sales representatives reps to immediately respond to complex customer questions without ever having to leave the conversation.Drift Logo PRNewsfotoDrift.com, Inc.PRNewswireThe AI will suggest a reply for the sales rep to use based on their companys website content and marketing materials, the context of that specific conversation and GPT. The sales rep will have the option to customize the suggested reply before sending, or dismiss it and generate a new suggested reply if the first one didnt meet their needs. The ability to generate suggested replies by repurposing any available content also provides realtime onthejob training for new sales reps which currently takes three months on average, teaching them how to respond accurately and in the right brand voice.Gaps in education and training were cited as the top barrier to AI adoption by 63 of marketers and sales reps polled in Drifts recent 2022 State of Marketing and Sales AI Report. Large language models, like ChatGPT, are helping change that by making AI usable and understandable to everyone. It is one of the first AI technologies made available to the public in a way that nontechnical experts can understand and experiment with.The buzz around ChatGPT, and the widespread experimentation that followed, has only underscored that conversationbased AI is paving the way of the future. But, it needs to be tailored to solve meaningful business challenges, said Matt Tippets, senior vice president at Drift. With Drifts ability to use Conversational AI to contextualize responses that augment the efforts of human teams, weve created a feature that helps sales reps of all experience levels be more productive, particularly relevant now with pressure on during a more difficult economic climate.While B2B sales and marketing professionals are excited by the possibilities of GPT implementations, many are hesitant about potential risks. By combining Drifts trusted Conversational AI with GPT, marketing and sales reps will be able to more quickly and accurately respond to customers in chat.This aligns with Drifts mission to help businesses connect with people at the right time, in the right place, with the right conversation.Additional features that will be available later this year within the Drift GPT integration include:Automated content creation and ongoing optimization of playbooksAutomated onboarding and AI topic trainingPersonalizing sales outreach and prioritizing target accountsIve always admired Drifts customercentric approach to building practical AI tools, and suggested replies is a great addition that will immediately increase productivity for users, said Paul Roetzer, founder and CEO of Marketing AI Institute.Drifts GPT integration will enter its Beta stage in March with select customers. Shortly thereafter, the integration will become more widely available to Drifts customers and new features will be added.To learn more about the new Drift GPT features or to join the waitlist, click here.About DriftDrift, the Conversation Cloud company, helps businesses connect with people at the right time, in the right place with the right conversation.

findings at the 118th Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Urological Association. Jacob Taylor, MD, assistant instructor in the Division of Urology at UT Southwestern Medical, will moderate a virtual press session featuring the following two abstracts.Indrani Bhattacharya, PhD, from Stanford University, developed an artificial intelligence AI model to rapidly and accurately identify cancer foci on MRI and compare its performance against radiologists. Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer on MRI: A comparison of an Artificial Intelligence model versus Radiologists.Natasha Gupta, MD, from New York University, performed a qualitative study to characterize female partners sexual health concerns and unmet needs. Understanding the Sexual Health Concerns and Needs of Female Partners of Prostate Cancer Survivors.Prostate cancer remains the most common cancer in men, with 1 in 8 being affected at some point in their lifetime. This session will focus on a diverse range of presentations that highlight unique areas within prostate cancer research, said Dr. Taylor. We will discuss advances in cancer detection using artificial intelligence and sexual health concerns and needs of female partners of prostate cancer survivors. Our goal is to learn more about emerging research areas in prostate cancer that have great potential to impact prostate cancer care in the near future.NOTE TO REPORTERS: Presenting authors and moderators are available to discuss their findings.

CONTRIBUTORSDoes AI mean the 4day workweek is almost hereNicholas GoldbergLos Angeles Times TNSId like to work four days a week instead of five. Wouldnt youId take Fridays off. The way I imagine it, itd be just a few years from now. A robot in a butlers uniform would serve us drinks in the backyard on what used to be just another workday. Id toss a ball around with the kids while ChatGPT did their homework for them.Who says the world is going to hell and the future is bleak Artificial intelligence, advanced robotics and job automation hold out the hope of less work, more leisure and long weekends every weekend.Thats the view, anyway, of Christopher Pissarides, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in economics and believes that thanks to AI and automation, society could move to a fourday week easily.He said itin an article that appeared in the L.A. Timeslast week.They could take away a lot of boring things that we do at work  and then leave only the interesting stuff to human beings, he added.Pissarides has writtenthat automation gets a bad rap and that we should embrace AI and automation without hesitation while helping workers make the transition to the new economy.Itd be great if hes right that productivity gains and increases in efficiency will be reinvested, spurring new innovations, creating new jobs and industries, and driving economic growth as older, less productive jobs are replaced with more advanced occupations and we all get Fridays off with no cut in pay.But Im skeptical that itll happen easily.I realize its presumptuous of me to question the optimism of a Nobel Prize winner, especially given that I didnt do so good in Intro to Economics 45 years ago.But, with all due respect, count me among those who wonder whether the financial benefits of automation will really be put to use improving workers wellbeing  or whether theyll just feed higher profits for shareholders and heftier bonuses for executives, thereby exacerbating income inequality.Count me among those who worry that employers will work hard to grab most of the savings for themselves unless society forces them not to.Automation, of one sort or another, is as old as humans are, and fear of losing jobs to machines goes back at least to the textile mills of the Industrial Revolution. Many of us learned in school aboutthe Luddites, a secret organization of disaffected early 19th century English mill workers who went around destroying automated looms and other newfangled machinery they feared would eliminate their jobs or worsen labor conditions.These days automation is moving faster than ever. A Goldman Sachs report released last month said300 million jobs worldwidecould be impacted or disrupted thanks to generative AI alone. A report by theMcKinsey Global Institutedetermined that up to half the jobs people do in the world could theoretically be automated.Already, salespeople are disappearing at my local RiteAid because of selfservice checkout machines. Parking garage attendants can hardly be found thanks to automatic gates, ticketdispensing machines and selfpaying kiosks. At airports, boarding passes are dispensed by machines. Baggage handlers are being displaced by robots, immigration officers by facial recognition technology.And do we think those workers are all off enjoying threeday weekendsWith the extraordinary innovations in AI, automation may soon move beyond bluecollar and lessskilled workers, increasingly affecting socalled knowledge workers with college educations. Whos at risk Think software engineers, tax preparers, copy editors and paralegals. For starters.Many economists share Pissarides optimistic view. They note that, historically, when automation has eliminated jobs, new ones offset the losses. Productivity gains drive down prices, which drives up spending and creates jobs. And innovation itself requires workers: Although we no longer employ blacksmiths, weve got auto mechanics, solar panel installers and airline pilots.One Massachusetts Institute of Technology studyfound that more than 60 of jobs in the U.S. in 2018 hadnt been invented in 1940.Furthermore, robots can do jobs that are undesirable or highly dangerous or require superhuman strength and stamina. In many cases, robots are faster, stronger, more accurate and more efficient than people.So there are definitely benefits to automation. But the challenge is to ensure theyre spread around.MIT economist Daron Acemoglu says that over the last four decades, jobs lost to automation havenotbeen replaced by an equal number of new ones. Since the late 1980s, he says, automation has increased income inequality rather than raising all boats.The real beneficiaries of automation during that period Corporations, their owners and in some cases workers with very high skill levels, especially those with postgraduate degrees.The case that workers will benefit from massscale automation is pretty weak, Acemoglu told me. The evidence indicates that the productivity gains from automation of the last four decades have been largely captured by companies and managers.Now Im not suggesting we should  or could  stop innovation or halt progress.But to mitigate the enormous disruption, the transition cannot be left entirely to the caprice of employers. Automations benefits must not simply be dispatched directly into the pockets of the Jeff Bezoses and Elon Musks of the world.Pissarides urges the government to provide income and jobtransition support to workers.Harry J. Holzer, a public policy professor at Georgetown University, calls for tax incentives and subsidies for good job creation. K12 education, he says, should be retooled to prepare 21st century workers with the communication skills, critical thinking abilities, creativity and good judgment that will be valuable and marketable in the new economy.Too often in history, society has left workers to fend for themselves in times of dramatic economic change. Is government committed, this time, to ensuring it doesnt happen againLike everyone else, Im eager for my fourday workweek.But I dont kid myself that itll happen on its own thanks to the generosity of the modernday mill owners. Itll take a fight.

The ripples caused by the COVID19 crisis are felt far and wide, and the worlds economies have taken a staggering blow. As with most things in life, however, this crisis has also brought some interesting side effects. Special feature                        Digital Transformation: A CXOs Guide                    Reimagining business for the digital age is the numberone priority for many of todays top executives. We offer practical advice and examples of how to do it right.Read MoreThe way to cope for practically every one of us, including organizations of all sizes and shapes, can be summarized in one infamous buzzword: digital transformation. This can mean different things depending on who you ask, from video calls and remote collaboration apps to more software as a service, cloud and machine learning investment. Also: Digital transformation: The difference between success and failure Whatever digital transformation means, as the aphorism by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella went, the COVID19 crisis brought years worth of digital transformation in months. Those who had strategically invested are reaping the benefits, those who did not are either out of the game or left with a patchwork of disparate initiatives and apps in place. Theres one thing in common however, regardless of which part in that journey youre at: as digital transformation accelerates, an increasing part of all business activity is leaving its footprint behind in the form of data. Eventually, every employee, customer and supplier interaction, every lead, every information bit and every process, will either take place digitally or be documented digitally. What this means in turn is that in theory, it should be possible to not just derive insights, as the promise of big data and analytics has been, but to go from data to information, and from information to knowledge. Yes, this does sound a lot like the journey towards the fourth industrial revolution, and the promise of artificial intelligence. In the near future, organizations will be datadriven, and the economy will be knowledgebased. Heres a shortlist of technologies and processes that can support it, and what they are about.  The data pyramid: from data to knowledge The representation of the relationships among data, information, knowledge and  ultimately  wisdom, known as the data pyramid, has long been part of the language of information science. In the new knowledgebased digital world, encoding and making use of business and operational knowledge is the key to making progress and staying competitive. The representation of the relationships among data, information, knowledge and ultimately wisdom, known as thedata pyramid, has long been part of the language of information scienceSo how do we go from data to information, and from information to knowledge Data is a collection of facts in a raw or unorganized form, such as numbers or characters. Without context, data does not mean much. For example, 18122020 is just a sequence of numbers. But if we define this sequence as a date in the DDMMYYY format, we can then interpret it as the 18th of December, 2020. With this added context, the numbers acquire a meaning. Information is data that has been processed in a way that makes it easier to measure, visualize and analyze  for a specific purpose. For example, we can organize our data in a way that exposes relationships between various seemingly disparate and disconnected data points. We can analyze the performance of the Dow Jones index by creating a graph of data points for a particular period of time, based on the data at each days closing. Knowledge is information that has been processed, organized and structured in some way, applied or put into action. For example, by capturing and expressing the meaning of relationships pertaining to our data points, we can automate insights, and extract new knowledge. A knowledge graph of semantic relationships can help explain how certain stocks influence the Dow Jones index, and how different events may affect their prices. Adding context to data turns it to information. Processing information turns it to knowledge. The keys to these transformations are connections and metadata. But there is another wellknown progression at play here. By now, the classification of various forms of analytics from simple to advanced is also well known and understood. The theory behind this classification is that the more advanced forms of analytics lead to AI. Of course, there is an implicit question there: what do we talk about, when we talk about AI  According to todays conventional wisdom, the answer is machine learning, or more specifically even, deep learning. That has not always been held as a selfevident truth, however. It probably wont be held as such for ever either. And it certainly is not held as such for everyone.  For a brief introduction to a more holistic view on AI, and a strong dose of inspiration, we recommend our recent conversation with AI prodigy Gary Marcus. From our part, lets try to approach the analytics progression from a different viewpoint, focusing on a specific data structure: graphs.  Graph Analytics What is the optimal way to go through a number of bridges The history of graph theory is linked to this question. The bridges in question were the bridges of Knigsberg. The year was 1736. And the person who formulated a model to answer this question was Leonhard Euler. Euler was a Swiss scientist and engineer, and much of his work is foundational to modern science. Eulers solution on the bridges of Knigsberg is the basis of graph theory. There is a line connecting Euler to modern data science. What Euler did was to model the bridges and the paths connecting them as nodes and edges in a graph. Euler formalized the relationships between nodes and edges. That formed the basis for many graph algorithms that can tackle problems such as the bridges of Knigsberg. In the new knowledgebased digital world, encoding and making use of business and operational knowledge is the key to making progress and staying competitive.The most famous graph algorithm is probably PageRank the foundation of Googles empire. PageRank models documents on the web as a graph, and uses links among them to derive relevance for a specific query. But Googles success with PageRank is just the tip of the iceberg. From the 18th century to today, a number of graph algorithms have been developed. Path finding, centrality, community detection and similarity are some of the main classes of graph algorithms. Graph algorithms have many applications in data analytics. From eBay and NASA to investigative journalists and independent data scientists, graph analytics power realworld use cases and make a difference every day in areas of recommendations and fraud detection to network analysis and natural language processing. This is why the analyst firm Gartner predicts that graph analytics will grow in the next few years due to the need to ask complex questions across complex data.  Graph Databases Leveraging connections in data is a prominent way of getting value out of data. Graph is the best way of leveraging connections, and graph databases excel at this. Graph databases make expressing and querying connection easy and powerful.  This is why graph databases are a good match in use cases that require leveraging connections in data: Antifraud, Recommendations, Customer 360 or Master Data Management. From operational applications to analytics, and from data integration to machine learning, graph gives you an edge. There is a difference between graph analytics and graph databases. Graph analytics can be performed on any back end, as they only require reading graphshaped data. Graph databases are databases with the ability to fully support both read and write, utilizing a graph data model, API and query language. Graph databases have been around for a long time, but the attention they have been getting since 2017 is off the charts. AWS and Microsoft moving in the domain, with Neptune and Cosmos DB respectively, exposed graph databases to a wider audience. This hitherto niche domain has been the hottest in data management since then. Besides trends, however, there are real reasons why graph databases are interesting, and real use cases they can help with. To quote Gartner again: The application of graph processing and graph DBMSs will grow at 100 percent annually through 2022 to continuously accelerate data preparation and enable more complex and adaptive data science. Graph data stores can efficiently model, explore and query data with complex interrelationships across data silos.Knowledge GraphsConnecting data silos is a prerequisite for knowledge management, and knowledge graphs excel at this. Knowledge graphs are a specific subclass of graphs, also known as semantic graphs. They come with metadata, schema, global identifier, and reasoning capabilities, which makes them ideal for capturing and managing knowledge. Its understandable why many people tend to think of graph as a new technology. The truth, however, is this technology is at least 20 years old. It has been largely initiated by none other than Tim BernersLee, who is also credited as the inventor of the Web. BernersLee published his Semantic Web manifesto in 2001. Although sidelined over the years, these principles and technology are still largely behind the Knowledge Graph renaissance. Google played a key role in the rise of graphs, and knowledge graphs. As the web itself is a prime use case for graphs, PageRank was born. Gartner has included knowledge graphs in its 2020 hype cycle for AI, at the peak of inflated expectationsDespite PageRanks success, crawling and categorizing content on the web is a very hard problem to solve without semantics and metadata. Hence Google embraced semantic technology, and coined the term Knowledge Graph in 2012. This, and the widespread adoption of schema.org that followed, marked the beginning of the meteoric rise of graph technology and knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs can address key challenges such as data governance and data integration. Ultimately, knowledge graphs can serve as the digital substrate to unify the philosophy of knowledge acquisition and organization with the practice of data management in the digital age. And ontologies, the elaborate schemas that govern knowledge graphs, are now being used by the Morgan Stanleys of the world.  Graphs, AI, and natural language processing You would be tempted to think that knowledge graphs are the end all for capturing and managing knowledge you would be wrong. Knowledge graphs excel in capturing knowledge explicitly, in a topdown way. Knowledge graphs are part of AI, the socalled good old AI, or symbolic AI. This is why Gartner has included knowledge graphs in its 2020 hype cycle for AI, at the peak of inflated expectations, no less. Knowledge graphs and ontologies may fare better than any other technology for managing explicit, a priori knowledge, but what about implicit, emergent, evolving knowledge This is where machine learning works well, but here, too, graphs may have a helping hand to lend. What does graph have to do with machine learning A lot, actually. And it goes both ways. Machine learning can help bootstrap and populate knowledge graphs. The information contained in graphs can boost the efficiency of machine learning approaches. What does graph have to do with machine learning A lot, actually. And it goes both ways. Image: OracleMachine learning, and its deep learning subdomain, make a great match for graphs. Machine learning on graphs is still a nascent technology, but one which is full of promise. Amazon, Alibaba, Apple, Facebook and Twitter are just some of the organizations using this in production, and advancing the state of the art. More than 25 of the research published in top AI conferences is graphrelated. Last but not least, according to Facebook AI researcher Fabio Petroni, graphs may not be the best way to obtain knowledge: As human beings, we already invented the best way of representing knowledge  text. With recent advances in Natural Language Processing NLP, we now have machines that can retrieve pieces of context, reason on top of that and solve knowledge intensive tasks without using a knowledge base, just using text and understanding text.Having come full circle, this reference points to the kind of holistic approach to AI, knowledge representation and reasoning that Gary Marcus vision lays out. We have been keeping track of this field, and will continue to do so and report back here.

Learn From helping diabetic patients to managing chronic illness: the journey of BeatOs AI platformBy Sindhu Kashyaap7th Oct 2020The minimum viable product MVP plays a vital role in understanding customer needs. It also gives investors a sense of what the product can achieve with scale. But, it is important to build the MVP frugally. Heres how BeatO, the Delhibased healthcare startup, did it. 0 claps0 Share on0 claps0 Share onShare onBeing diabetic themselves, Yash Sehgal and Gautam Chopra realised the need for a platform that could give them the insights and information on how well they could manage their blood sugar levels.The duo had an initial hypothesis: for people who monitor their sugar levels  a personalised interpretation of their sugar level readings, along with a realtime intervention  would be very useful in making a positive impact in their blood glucose values.This led them to start the fullstack healthtech platform BeatO in 2015, which provides information and products for diabetes management. With a focus on chronic illness management in India, the startup has over 100,000 users on its platform, adding close to 10,0000 users each month.BeatO provides diabetic patients with a smartphone glucometer and app, which connects them with inhouse specialists, helps share and analyse readings, track fitness levels, and manage diet with a range of diabeticfriendly food products. BeatOs platform has now evolved to track chronic illnesses as well.ALSO READYS Learn From cofounders turning security guards to reaching 2 million homes, the MVP journey of MyGateStart smallIn the beginning, the cofounders focussed on their hypothesis and made a simple app, where users could manually fill in their readings. If the readings were beyond the appropriate range, the inhouse specialist diabetes educators would immediately assist a call to provide insights to the user.We were happy with the initial user engagement and feedback. We received appreciation for these interventions when it was of the utmost importance. However, there was other learning that we felt was needed in the process to make the product more appealing to our users, says Gautam.Firstly, they needed to solve the problem of data acquisition as most users did not want to feed the data in manually. The startup solved this successfully through its smartphoneconnected glucometer device.Secondly, while diabetes educators could call people, we needed a more intelligent system to triage users, and provide more contextualised, personalised actions. This overtime gave birth to HealthNeuron  BeatOs AI engine, explains Gautam.Keep evolvingThe cofounder explains that the product has to be everevolving. As more customers started using the startups platform, several rich insights started to come in, many of which were built into the product. BeatOs product team works very closely with the customer experience team to understand various areas of improvement, as well as areas of further product evolution.By having our ears close to the ground and seeking active feedback and response from our users, we introduce features based on data and the rich insights we gather. There is a balance in the thought process that founders need to strike. As an MVP, it should focus on learning about consumers interest in the product rather than in earnings. Also, at times, there is a tendency to add many features, thereby losing sight of the core value  this can lead to overinvestment by an already capitalstarved startup, explains Gautam.ALSO READYS Learn Heres how founders can master business strategy with five top movesBe nimble and look at dataBeatO cofounders, fairly early into the operations, also concluded that the performance of their product will be based on the data and user feedback.However, to improve and commercialise the product, at times, it may take more time than one envisages. For this, we now try to evaluate what is the effort versus the impact the product will have in the short, mid, or long term, and then decide how we wish to include the product evolution in our pipeline, says Gautam.Keep the focus sharpAccording to Gautam, the team at BeatO focusses on two things Opportunity arising out of a new or evolving market situation: For example, the COVID19 pandemic has provided a unique opportunity for the startup to launch its Virtual Endocrine Clinic, as well as its Diabetes Total Insurance Subscription feature, as both became critical user needs overnight.An outcome of what data tells us: For example, BeatO realised that people responded favourably to compliancebased rewards. In fact, it built this feature, where it demonstrates a great relationship with health economics and health outcomes.Focus on tech, but not over consumer needsFor any startup, during the MVP phase, having a significant focus on learning and observing customers actual behaviour with the product is more important than the tech architecture.The core architecture of the system should be built around the primary offering and should be flexible enough to evolve as new offerings are in place, Gautam says. If a Chief Product Officer CFO is confident that an MVP needs to be commercialised, having a solid core team that drives the tech architecture, early team hiring, and optimising costs can be paramount.The simplest way to manage the architecture is to build small, but think big. This will make the system futureready, and will always have the possibility of enhancements to be added when the time comes, he adds.Advising CPOs, Gautam says, Try getting to the root of the real problem that your product has to solve.Edited by Suman Singh Indias most prolific entrepreneurship conference TechSparks is back With it comes an opportunity for earlystage startups to scale and succeed.
